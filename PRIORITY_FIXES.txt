BRUTAL CODE REVIEW - PRIORITY FIXES FOR ERG ZONE CALCULATOR
================================================================

CRITICAL (Fix These First or Guido Will Cry):
1. **ELIMINATE CODE DUPLICATION** - Create a base ZoneCalculator class
   - Both calculators share 90% of their logic
   - Extract common file reading, error handling, and validation
   - This is Software Engineering 101

2. **FIX FILE I/O PERFORMANCE DISASTER** 
   - Load config files ONCE in constructor, not every method call
   - Cache the configuration data
   - You're currently doing O(n) file reads when it should be O(1)

3. **CONSISTENT RETURN TYPES**
   - Pick ONE return type per method (don't mix str/float)
   - Create proper data classes for zone results
   - Stop returning error messages as strings mixed with actual data

4. **SEPARATE CONCERNS PROPERLY**
   - Calculator classes should ONLY calculate
   - Create separate classes for: FileLoader, Validator, Formatter
   - Follow Single Responsibility Principle

HIGH PRIORITY (Do This Week):
5. **PROPER ERROR HANDLING**
   - Use specific exceptions, not generic Exception catching
   - Create custom exception classes (InvalidZoneError, ConfigError)
   - Remove print statements, use proper logging
   - Don't catch and re-raise without adding value

6. **ELIMINATE MAGIC NUMBERS**
   - Define constants: METERS_PER_500M = 500, METERS_PER_2KM = 2000
   - Document what these numbers represent in your domain
   - Make them configurable if they might change

7. **FIX main.py LOGIC BUG**
   - You're using pace zones config for HR zone iteration
   - Load both configs separately and iterate correctly
   - This is a runtime bug waiting to happen

8. **ADD PROPER VALIDATION**
   - Validate zone names exist before processing
   - Validate config file structure on load
   - Add bounds checking for all numeric inputs

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Sprint):
9. **IMPROVE TYPE HINTS**
   - Use Union types properly instead of float | str
   - Add return type hints to all functions
   - Consider using Pydantic for data validation

10. **ADD CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT**
    - Don't hardcode config file paths
    - Use environment variables or config management
    - Make the system configurable

11. **BETTER STRING FORMATTING**
    - Consistent time format handling
    - Use f-strings consistently
    - Consider using dataclasses with __str__ methods

12. **ADD PROPER LOGGING**
    - Replace all print statements with logging
    - Add different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
    - Make logging configurable

LOW PRIORITY (When You Have Time):
13. **ADD DOCSTRINGS**
    - Every class and method needs proper documentation
    - Explain the domain concepts (what are these zones?)
    - Add usage examples

14. **IMPROVE PROJECT STRUCTURE**
    - Add models/ directory for data classes
    - Add utils/ for helper functions
    - Add config/ management module

15. **ADD COMPREHENSIVE TESTS**
    - Test edge cases (null bounds, invalid inputs)
    - Test error conditions
    - Add integration tests

ARCHITECTURAL SUGGESTIONS:
- Consider using dependency injection for config loading
- Implement a proper Zone data class with bounds and metadata
- Create a ZoneCalculatorFactory for different calculator types
- Add a proper CLI interface instead of hardcoded main()

PERFORMANCE NOTES:
- Current implementation: O(n) file reads per calculation
- Target implementation: O(1) after initial load
- Memory usage is fine, but I/O is terrible

The good news? This is fixable. The bad news? You've got work to do.
Start with the CRITICAL items and work your way down.

Remember: Code is read more than it's written. Make it readable.
